### Project Title
Bikeshare Project 

### Description
The Python script is written for the project 3 of the Udacity's Programming for Data Science Nanodegree. I wrote the Python code to import US bike share data, answer interesting questions about those data, and by computing descriptive statistics from the data. I also wrote the script so it allows the users to query the database with different filters.
### Files used
