### Project Title
Bikeshare Project 

### Description
The Python script is written for the project 3 of the Udacity's Programming for Data Science Nanodegree. I wrote the Python code to import US bike share data, answer interesting questions about those data, and by computing descriptive statistics from the data. I also wrote the script so it allows the users to query the database with different filters.
### Files used
bikeshare.py
chicago.csv
new_york_city.csv
washington.csv
### Dataset
The dataset contains bike share data for Chicago, Washington and New York cities. The dataset cover the first six months of the year 2017. The dataset is provided by Motivate, a bike share system provider for many major cities in the United States, to uncover bike share usage patterns.
